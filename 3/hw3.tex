\section*{1 Diffuse-to-Bounds Decision Making}

For each class that you are looking for in the world, you have a model $p_c(x_1,...,x_t | \theta_c)$ 
such that you can assign probabilities to sequences of observations, given the specific parameters 
($\theta$) of that model for class $c$.  Consider the case where there are two competing 
models with parameters $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$.  Assuming independent measurements, we have 
to decide which of the following two forms is generating the measurements:\\

\[ p_0(x_1,...,x_t | \theta_0) = p(\theta_0)p(x_1 | \theta_0)...p(x_t | \theta_0)  \]
\[ p_1(x_1,...,x_t | \theta_1) = p(\theta_1)p(x_1 | \theta_1)...p(x_t | \theta_1)  \]

One approach to this decision would be be thresholding the likelihood ratio, in line with the 
Neyman-Pearson theorem. 

\[ \text{LR} = \frac{p_1(\theta_1 | x_1,...,x_t)}{p_0(\theta_0 | x_1,...,x_t)} \]

By Baye's rule, because the marginals cancel:

\[ \text{LR} = \frac{p(\theta_1)p_1(x_1,...,x_t | \theta_1)}
{p(\theta_0)p_0(x_1,...,x_t | \theta_0)} \]

However, we also want to be able to make this decision as soon as possible, again given the 
probabilities we will allow for false positives and false negatives 
($\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively).  So we will check the cumulative likelihood ratio, $r$,
at each measurement, and stop taking measurements when we have enough information to decide 
beyond our preset thresholds.

\[ r = \frac{p(\theta_1)}{p(\theta_0)}\prod_{i=1}^{t}\frac{p(x_i | \theta_1)}{p(x_i | \theta_0)}\]

Now we just need to pick thresholds on this ratio.  For predetermined values of $\alpha$ and 
$\beta$, Wald proved that $T_1 \leq \frac{1 - \beta}{\alpha}$ and $T_2 \geq \frac{\beta}
{1 - \alpha}$ are tight bounds on the upper and lower thresholds we should use. Combined with 
our decision rule:

\[ \begin{cases}
   \text{Decide class 1} & r \geq T_1 \\
   \text{Decide class 0} & r \leq T_2 \\
   \text{Otherwise, continue}
   \end{cases}
\]

We now have a completely specified decision rule.  To update the likelihood ratio more easily, 
we will store the $\log$ likelihood ratio instead, and use the logs of our thresholds as well.  
Now each update is a sum instead of a product, and instead of $T_1$ and $T_2$, we will use their
logs.

\section*{2 One-Neuron Decisions}

\paragraph{1)} Compute the false reject error rate when the lower decision threshold is

\subparagraph{a)} $-1$

\subparagraph{b)} $-1.2$

\subparagraph{c)} $-1.8$

\paragraph{2)} Compute how long it takes to decide GREEN with k action potentials when the decision
thresholds are

\subparagraph{a)} $\pm 1.2$\\

While there are no action potentials, an observer of the neuron would drift closer to the lower 
decision threshold at a rate of $(\ell_0 - \ell_1)\log_{10}(e) = (1 $Hz$ - 10 $Hz$)  0.434 = -3.906$
units per second. With a GREEN threshold at $-1.2$ units, it will only take $0.308$ seconds to 
decide GREEN without any action potentials.\\

Now with $k$ action potentials, each bringing us $\log_{10}(\frac{\ell_1}{\ell_0}) = \log_{10}(
\frac{10 \text{Hz}}{1 \text{Hz}}) = 1 $ units away from the lower decision threshold, 
it will take $0.308 + 0.256 k$ seconds 
for an observer of the cell to decide the (beyond the set threshold) that there is a GREEN light.\\

\subparagraph{b)} $\pm 1.8$\\

With the lower threshold of $-1.8$, it will take $\frac{1.8}{3.9} - \frac{k}{3.9} = 
0.462 + 0.256 k$ seconds 
for an observer of the cell to decide (beyond threshold) that there is a GREEN light.\\

\paragraph{3)} Compute how long it takes to decide RED (both upper and lower bounds) with decision
thresholds at $\pm 1.8$ using

\subparagraph{a)}

\paragraph{4)} Use the SPRT code on Moodle to simulate the neuronâ€™s decision. Confirm your calculated
decision times from 2.3.a and 2.3.b. Provide the generated figures in your
